//! Permission manager — the cross-platform piece of the "permission-as-DOM"
//! architecture (`SUPER_PLAN_2.md` §1.5 and `scripts/research/08_permission_dom_nodes.md`).
//!
//! Stores per-capability state + a refcount keyed on bearing DOM nodes. Three
//! callers drive it:
//!
//! - The **layout pass** scans the styled DOM for permission-bearing
//!   `NodeTypes` (`GeolocationProbe`, `CameraPreview`, `SensorProbe`, etc.) and
//!   calls `subscribe` / `release` to maintain the refcount. The diff
//!   between consecutive layouts yields the [`PermissionDiffEvent`]s the
//!   platform backend translates into native subscribe/release operations.
//!
//! - The **platform backend** (`dll/src/desktop/extra/permission/<plat>.rs`)
//!   observes the diff events and issues the matching native call
//!   (`AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess` on iOS, `ActivityCompat.requestPermissions`
//!   on Android, etc.). When the OS callback fires it calls `set_status`,
//!   which is mirrored back into callback land via the `CallbackInfo`
//!   accessor `get_permission_status`.
//!
//! - **Callbacks** read `get_status(...)` synchronously to decide whether
//!   to mount a permission-bearing node or show a fallback (the
//!   "user-gesture-first" pattern in the research brief §8.3).
//!
//! The manager has no platform dependencies and is `no_std`-friendly (uses
//! `alloc::collections::BTreeMap` + `alloc::vec::Vec`).
