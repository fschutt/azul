//! Host-language callback invoker registry.
//!
//! Managed-FFI bindings (Lua, Ruby, Perl, PHP, OCaml, Node, C#, Java, …) can't
//! generate C-ABI trampolines for callback typedefs that take aggregate args
//! by value — that's a libffi / LuaJIT FFI / ruby-ffi limitation we can't fix
//! at the host. This module provides the alternative the user's analysis
//! settled on: each language registers **one** generic invoker function at
//! module load time, plus a releaser that fires when a host-language handle
//! goes out of use.
//!
//! Every callback the host registers becomes a `Callback { cb, ctx }` pair
//! whose `cb` is a *static thunk* in libazul (so by-value args land on a
//! native frame the way the framework already expects), and whose `ctx` is
//! a `RefAny` payload that carries an opaque host-language `u64` handle.
//! The thunk reads `info.get_ctx()`, extracts the handle, and dispatches to
//! the registered per-kind invoker — which, on the host side, looks up the
//! callable by id in a host-managed table and runs it. When the RefAny's
//! refcount drops to zero, the destructor calls back through the registered
//! releaser so the host can drop its table entry, mirroring Python's
//! `Py<PyAny>` lifetime story without making libazul link against any host
//! runtime.
//!
//! ## API surface
//!
//! - [`AzApp_setHostHandleReleaser`] — register the host's "drop this id"
//!   callback once per process. Fires when a host-handle [`RefAny`] is
//!   collected.
//! - Per callback kind, [`crate::impl_managed_callback!`] expands to:
//!   - A static thunk (`extern "C" fn`) compiled into libazul.
//!   - A `<Wrapper>::create_from_host_handle(u64)` constructor.
//!   - An `AzApp_set<Kind>Invoker(...)` setter for the host-side per-kind
//!     pointer-arg invoker.
//!
//! ## Why a single shared releaser
//!
//! Per-kind invokers are necessarily distinct — each callback typedef has
//! a different signature, so the host has to register a libffi closure per
//! typedef anyway. The releaser, on the other hand, has the same signature
//! for every kind (`extern "C" fn(u64)`), so we can share one slot across
//! all callbacks; the host registers it once and every kind's destructor
//! routes through it.
