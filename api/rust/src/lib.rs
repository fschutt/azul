// --------------------------------
// 
// 2.1. Grants
// 
// Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
// non-exclusive license:
// 
// (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
//     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
//     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
//     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
//     as part of a Larger Work; and
// 
// (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
//     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
//     Contributions or its Contributor Version.
// 
// 2.2. Effective Date
// 
// The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
// become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
// distributes such Contribution.
// 
// 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
// 
// The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
// this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
// distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
// Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
// Contributor:
// 
// (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
//     or
// 
// (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
//     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
//     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
//     Version); or
// 
// (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
//     its Contributions.
// 
// This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
// or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
// the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
// 
// 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
// 
// No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
// distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
// License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
// permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
// 
// 2.5. Representation
// 
// Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
// Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
// to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
// 
// 2.6. Fair Use
// 
// This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
// applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
// equivalents.
// 
// 2.7. Conditions
// 
// Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
// in Section 2.1.
// 
// 3. Responsibilities
// -------------------
// 
// 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
// 
// All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
// Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
// the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
// Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
// License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
// attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
// Form.
// 
// 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
// 
// If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
// 
// (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
//     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
//     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
//     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
//     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
// 
// (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
//     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
//     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
//     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
// 
// 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
// 
// You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
// provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
// the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
// Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
// Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
// License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
// under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
// the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
// Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
// License(s).
// 
// 3.4. Notices
// 
// You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
// (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
// or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
// the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
// the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
// 
// 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
// 
// You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
// indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
// Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
// behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
// such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
// You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
// liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
// indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
// disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
// jurisdiction.
// 
// 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
// ---------------------------------------------------
// 
// If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
// License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
// statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
// the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
// describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
// be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
// Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
// or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
// recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
// 
// 5. Termination
// --------------
// 
// 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
// if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
// compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
// Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
// Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
// ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
// non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
// come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
// Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
// notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
// first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
// from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
// Your receipt of the notice.
// 
// 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
// infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
// counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
// directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
// You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
// 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
// 
// 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
// end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
// have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
// prior to termination shall survive termination.

// *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
// *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
// *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
// *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
// *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
// *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
// *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
// *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
// *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
// *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
// *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
// *                                                                      *

// *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
// *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
// *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

// *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *

// *                                                                      *
// ************************************************************************
// 
// 8. Litigation
// -------------
// 
// Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
// courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
// place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
// jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
// Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
// cross-claims or counter-claims.
// 
// 9. Miscellaneous
// ----------------
// 
// This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
// matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
// unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
// necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
// that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
// shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
// 
// 10. Versions of the License
// ---------------------------
// 
// 10.1. New Versions
// 
// Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
// 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
// publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
// distinguishing version number.
// 
// 10.2. Effect of New Versions
// 
// You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
// of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
// or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
// steward.
// 
// 10.3. Modified Versions
// 
// If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
// create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
// modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
// any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
// such modified license differs from this License).
// 
// 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
// Licenses
// 
// If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
// Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
// notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
//
