//! azul is a library for creating graphical user interfaces in Rust. 
//! 
//! ## How it works
//! 
//! azul requires your app data to "serialize" itself into a UI. 
//! This is different from how other GUI frameworks work, so it requires a bit of explanation:
//! 
//! Your app data is one global struct for your whole application. This is the "model". 
//! azul takes your model and requires you to build a DOM tree to translate the model into a view.
//! This (layouting, restyling, constraint solving) is done every 2 milliseconds. However, if your 
//! UI doesn't change, nothing is done (in order to not stress the CPU too much).
//!
//! This model makes conditional UI elements and conditional styling very easy. azul takes care
//! of caching for you - your CSS and DOM elements are cached and diffed for changes, in order to 
//! maximize performance. A full screen redraw should not take longer than 16 milliseconds 
//! (currently the frame time is around 1 - 2 milliseconds).
//! 
//! ## Hello world example
//! 
//! For more examples, please look in the `/examples` folder.
