//! DOM cache for library-internal use
//!
//! # Diffing the DOM
//!
//! Changes in the DOM can happen in three ways:
//!
//! - An element changes its content An element is pushed as a child The order / childs of an element
//! - are restructured
//!
//! In order for the caching to be effective, we need to solve the  problem of only adding
//! EditVariable-s if needed. In order to do that, we need two elements for each DOM node:
//!
//! - The self-hash (the hash of the current DOM node, including hashing the content)
//! - The hashes of the individual children (like a `Vec<DomHash>`), in their correct order
//!
//! For detecting these changes, we build an `Arena<DomHash>` (empty on startup) and a
//! `HashMap<(DomHash, bool) -> LayoutRect>`. The latter stores all active EditVariables.  Whenever we
//! insert or remove from the HashMap, we also remove the variables from the solver
//!
//! When a re-layout is required, we hash the nodes from the UiDescription, starting from the root. Each
//! time we go to the next sibling / next child, this change is also reflected by going through the
//! `Arena<DomHash>`. For each node, we calculate the self-hash of the node and compare it with the hash
//! in that position in the `Arena<DomHash>`. If the hash does not exist in the `Arena<DomHash>`, we
//! insert it in the `HashMap<(DomHash, bool)`, create a new LayoutRect and add the variables to the
//! solver. We set the `bool` to true to indicate, that this hash is currently active in the DOM and
//! should not be removed. Then we add the hash to the `Arena<DomHash>`.
//!
//! If there is a hash, but the hashes differ, this means that either the order of the current siblings
//! were  changed or the actual contents of the node were changed. So we look up the hash in the
//! `HashMap<(DomHash, bool)>`.  If we can find it, this means that we already have EditVariables in the
//! solver corresponding to the node and the node was simply reordered.
//! If we can't find it, it's either a completely new DOM element or the contents of the node have changed.
//!
//! Lastly, we go through the `HashMap<(DomHash, bool)>` and remove the edit variables if the `bool` is false,
//! meaning that the variable was not present in the current DOM tree, so leaving the variables in the solver
//! would be garbage.
